Abstract

Introduction
-Paper to work on: Optimal Control of SOAs using Artificial Intelligence for Sub-Nanosecond Optical switching
-Attempts to minimize switching speeds of SOA for effective use in data centre networks.
-Semiconductor optical amplifiers as switches and their issues: overshoot, settling and guard time.
-Methods used as control for SOA in the past: step, PISIC, MISIC. Investigate which characteristics proved useful to utilize them again. Use of PISIC shell.
-AI control for sub-nanosecond switching. Method is more important than signal in paper in use. 
-Transfer function used for SOA based on equivalent circuit.

Aims and Objectives
-Understand research done by paper on AI algorith for control and which method was found to be most ideal for the drive signal of the SOA
-Research more into PSO algorithm used for ultra-fast control
-Understand past methods used to optimize control signal
-Run simulations of current algorithm, sample size and method to view
results and use them as benchmark for future results.
-Reducing the sample rate (240 samples) as current drive signal was oversampled, as the -3dB frequency response of the SOA is at 0.5 GHZ whereas 240 dimensions in a 20 ns time period results into a 6 GHz input. Manipulating dimensions, which correspond to points in signal, could allow for further optical gain.
-Identify the minimum number of samples that can be used before 
the performance is affected or iterations do not need to be 
increased drastically
-Improve the equivalent circuit tranfer function to better emulate the SOA behaviour and thus allow the drive signal found from the simulated tranfer function to be more effective in real world applications.
-Study use of cascaded SOAs. Examine whether individual or 
combinational optimization would be ideal. Find how ASE noise will be affected and whether additional work will need to be done on the circuit to reduce distortion which comes with additional gain.
-Use FPGA's embedded DAC to input the driving signal into the SOA
-Shift focus of initial research partially onto actual wave generation rather than the method used

Preliminary Assessment of Risks
-Remote access of FPGA or possibly will need to access for the lab later on.
-Wide variety of topics that could be addressed in the research papers; have to focus one ones that can improve existing research the most.
