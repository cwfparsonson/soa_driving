# SOA Drive Signal Optimisation with Artificial Intelligence

**Documentation**: https://soa-driving.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

This project formed part of the journal paper 'An Artificial 
Intelligence Approach to Optimal Control of Sub-Nanosecond 
SOA-Based Optical Switches' (link will be provided when published). 
All data (https://doi.org/10.5522/04/12356696.v1) used in the 
paper was generated with this code. 



## Getting Started

Each of the PSO, ACO and GA packages have different setup requirements
and work in different ways. Please see individual folders for separate
instructions for use of each package.
